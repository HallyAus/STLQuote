Read `memory/HANDOFF.md` to understand where we left off.
Run `bd ready --json` to see the current task queue.
Check `strategy/todo-list.md` for high-level priorities.

Summarise:
1. What was accomplished last session
2. What's in progress or blocked
3. Top priority task from beads
4. Suggest what to work on next

If HANDOFF.md doesn't exist or is empty, say so and ask what to focus on.
