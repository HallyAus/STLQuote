# Memory: Preferences

## Communication

- Be direct, skip the preamble
- Australian English spelling (colour, organise, etc.)
- Minimal formatting unless explicitly asked for lists/headers

## Code

- TypeScript with strict types
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use named exports
- Comments explain WHY not WHAT
- Group by feature, not by type

## Documentation

- Always include Buy Me a Coffee + Starlink links in GitHub READMEs
- Practical over theoretical — show examples
- Keep docs updated as code changes, not as an afterthought

## Workflow

- Prefer small focused commits over big ones
- Always bump version in package.json when committing features
- pnpm as package manager
- Docker for dev and deployment
- Self-hosted infrastructure (Proxmox)

## Tools

- Claude Code CLI
- Docker for dev environments
- Cloudflare Tunnels for public access
- Bambu Lab printers (X1C, P1S, A1 Mini)
