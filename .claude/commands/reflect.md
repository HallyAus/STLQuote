Review this session for learnings, discoveries, and decisions that should be captured.

1. Were any bugs found? → Create a file in `specs/bugs/` if not already done
2. Were any workarounds or gotchas discovered? → Update `strategy/learnings.md`
3. Were any decisions made (tech choices, architecture, patterns)? → Update `specs/decisions.md` AND `.claude/rules/memory-decisions.md`
4. Did the user share any new facts or preferences? → Update `.claude/rules/memory-profile.md` or `memory-preferences.md`
5. Were any assumptions corrected? → Update the relevant memory file

Report what was captured and what was already up to date.
