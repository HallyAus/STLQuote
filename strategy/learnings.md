# Project Learnings

> Things discovered during development. Gotchas, workarounds, and non-obvious knowledge.
> Claude updates this when discoveries are made (see CLAUDE.md mandatory memory rules).

## Format

Each entry: `[YYYY-MM-DD] Learning — Context`

## Learnings

<!-- Claude: add new entries at the top -->

- [YYYY-MM-DD] [e.g., AlphaESS Modbus register 0x0020 returns SOC as percentage * 10, not raw percentage]
- [YYYY-MM-DD] [e.g., Shopify webhook verification requires raw body, not parsed JSON]
- [YYYY-MM-DD] [e.g., Docker Alpine images missing tzdata — need to install for timezone support]
