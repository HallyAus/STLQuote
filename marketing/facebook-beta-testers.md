**Looking for 10 beta testers for Printforge Quote — get lifetime free access**

Hey everyone,

I've been building **Printforge Quote** — a business tool built specifically for 3D print shops. It handles cost calculations, professional quotes, invoicing, job tracking, material management, and more.

I'm looking for **10 people** to test it out and give honest feedback. In return, you'll get **lifetime free Pro access** (normally $29/mo).

**What you'd be testing:**
- Cost calculator with STL/G-code upload
- Professional quote generation with PDF export
- Invoice system with GST/tax support
- Job tracking kanban board
- Material and printer management
- Client portal for quote approval
- Xero accounting integration
- And heaps more

**What I need from you:**
- Use it for your real business (or a realistic test)
- Give me honest feedback on what works and what doesn't
- Report any bugs you find
- ~30 mins of your time over 2 weeks

**Interested?** Drop a comment or DM me and I'll get you set up.

For everyone else — **Printforge Quote is launching soon**. Join the waitlist to be first in line:

Built by a maker, for makers.
